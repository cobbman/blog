It's been a long time since I last sat down to write a blog post. I'm excited to start writing again - it's been on my mind for a while, but also been hard to find the time. In life though, I found it to be true that you only get time to do things you make the the time for. So here I am making the time.

Though I've been blogging for almost 25 years now, this blog feels a bit like starting new. Partly because the tech stack is different - I've built this using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) which I'm really excited about because working with it feels like combining the simplicity of HTML or Markdown with the advantages of a modern stack. My very first "blog post" was written in HTML and I'm currently writing this post in Markdown. I enjoy the simplicity and speed of storing my posts as text files instead of a database.

### Blogging for 25 years

I wrote my first "blog post" sometime in 1998, but at that time it was just something I did to put content on my website (the term "blog" wasn't coined until later, so I just called it my website). I had learned enough HTML on my own to make my first website but I did not know what to put on it. So, I started writing updates about my life and sharing information about things I liked. Keep in mind this was before cell phones became mainstream and even though the internet was becoming commonplace in people's homes, it definitely was not integrated into our lives back then as it is today. I still remember how amazing the experience was to publish my website on the world wide web! I would tell all my friends and family to go check out my website because it was so exciting (I probably annoyed them with the requests, lol).

### Blogging To Learn

I've been inspired to write long-form posts thanks to [the essays written by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html). It's not how I usually write - my posts are normally short-form updates or code tutorials.

It is said that in order to truly learn a subject one must try to teach it. Only through that practice do we internalize the dynamics of a subject. It's in the writing of Essays that I hope to both teach future readers and myself about interesting subjects. Along the way I will share tips and code for programming and web development, and occasional life updates.

I invite you to share with me in this blogging journey.
